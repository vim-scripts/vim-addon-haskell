reconfigures cabal project, run cabal in background. Suggests import lines based on tag files and quickfix errors ...

This all is based on vim-addon-actions thus you can bind the "recompile" action to a key or to the if any buf was written action.

Want to run ghci in VIM? give SHIM or vim-addon-async a try.
